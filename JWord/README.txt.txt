JWord

See the FileStructure for a general reference of how the program is structured

Main creates a dictionary and a target dictionary, selects a word, and calls GUI
GUI is split into two major components, Keyboard and LetterGrid
Keyboard creates the UI keyboard and passes the user interaction to letterGrid
LetterGrid creates the game board UI and handles all of the game logic
